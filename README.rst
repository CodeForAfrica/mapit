MapIt
=====

MapIt is an open source project to help people run a web service that maps
geographical points to administrative areas. It is useful for anyone who has
the co-ordinates of a point on Earth, and who needs to find out what country,
region, city, constituency, or state it lies within. Itâ€™s also great for
looking up the shapes of all those boundaries.

It was created in 2003 by `mySociety <https://www.mysociety.org/>`__, a UK
charity, for use by their various tools needing admin area lookup.

Installation
------------

MapIt can be installed as a Django app, or as a standalone server. For full
details, please see our site at http://code.mapit.mysociety.org/ for help
and documentation.

Mapit Africa

Mapit Africa (mapit.hurumap.org) uses the django app 
`project <https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/mapit/tree/geo-files/project>`_ to host administrative 
areas geographical boundaries and maps geographical points for more than 10 African countries.

Development

We use docker-based environment for development and deployment. Refer to the 
`docker-compose.yml <https://github.com/TakwimuAfrica/Dashboard/blob/master/docker-compose.yml>`_ file.

To get started, clone this repository and spin up docker-containers as shown below. 


- git clone git@github.com:CodeforAfrica/mapit.git

- docker-compose up

Once containers are up, visit `<http:localhost:8000>`_

Countries' geofiles are available in the folder `geo`.
The file `import.md <https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/mapit/tree/geo-files/geo/import.md>`_ has
steps on how to import MapIt data. Make sure you're on the web container bash to run import commands.
